This is the first ever digital clock that I program purposely to make one that looks like a bomb but is not xD

Button 1 :
- change mode from clock view to setAlarm,
- click once to set the minutes
- click again to set the hours
- click again to return to clock view

Button 2 :
- click multiple times to set the minutes / hours you desire to

Button 3 (rocker switch) :
- turn off the buzzer

Button 4 :
- reset the alarm back to 00:00

side note : make sure to turn off the rocker switch to avoid alarm waking you up at unwanted times

features to be added:
- power saving mode : turn off display, let the rtc do its work
- vibrate modes
